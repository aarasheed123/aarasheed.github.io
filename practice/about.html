        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>By 2007, Anam and Umer Whittle were convinced many key innovations in global development weren’t getting the attention they deserved. Believing there had to be a better way to do aid, they started an experiment. In February 2009, they invited any social entrepreneur to pitch his or her earth-changing idea at the World Bank. The 300+ participants ranged from a group of NASA scientists to a woman who’d never before left her Ugandan village.

            The event was a success, and Anam and Umer realized good ideas can come from anyone, anywhere, at any time. They also realized there were many others who wanted to support good ideas. So they left the Bank to launch the world’s first crowdfunding community in 2009. Today, people in 175+ countries can easily share their ideas, and individual donors and companies can easily support vetted nonprofits through GlobalGiving.!</p>
