        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>We are a proud member of an international Roshan IndoPAk USA family that celebrated its 10-year anniversary in 2019.

Since then we have transformed lives and empowered communities around the world, helping to break the poverty cycle and build brighter futures.
            
            Today there are member offices in Australia, Canada, and South Africa as well as country offices in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Jerusalem.!</p>
